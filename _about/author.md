I am a software engineer at a financial research company, focused on tools, support and development for a high-performance computing system. Previously, I worked at Sophos, where I created WWW::SFDC, a set of perl packages for DevOps on the Salesforce.com platform.

I also sing and take photographs. I can be contacted by [email](mailto:alex@alexander-brett.co.uk).
